# 🎟️ Decentralized Event Ticketing with Proof of Purchase  

A beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** for a decentralized event ticketing system.  
This project demonstrates how blockchain can bring **transparency, security, and verifiable ownership** to event ticketing — no middlemen, no scams, just pure trust.  

---

## 🧩 Project Description  

This project is a simple decentralized ticketing platform built using **Solidity**.  
Event organizers can create events, sell tickets directly to users, and buyers get **on-chain proof of purchase** recorded as a unique transaction receipt on the Ethereum blockchain.  

The smart contract ensures that:  
- Ticket ownership is **verifiable** and **transferable**.  
- All sales are **transparent** and **immutable**.  
- Organizers can securely **withdraw funds** after sales.  

---

## 🚀 What It Does  

- **Event Creation:** Organizers can create new events with details like name, date, ticket price, and quantity.  
- **Ticket Purchase:** Users can buy tickets directly by sending the exact ticket price in ETH.  
- **Proof of Purchase:** Each ticket purchase emits a unique hash as proof of purchase, stored permanently on the blockchain.  
- **Ticket Transfer:** Buyers can transfer tickets to other users securely.  
- **Funds Withdrawal:** Organizers can withdraw collected ETH safely.  
- **Verification:** Anyone can verify who owns which ticket, or whether a ticket is valid.
